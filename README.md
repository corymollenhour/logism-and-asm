# logism-and-asm
This is a functioning RSC Microcode processor that adds numbers 1 to n in the accumulator

To test, use logism (http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and load the files provided. 

This is the last project in a series of 9 projects that my class used as a final exam project. Each project built itself from the previous one. The aim was to create a simple processor that could read in assembly (converted to byte code) and calculate whatever we chose. I chose to make a calculator that would add numbers 1 to n.
